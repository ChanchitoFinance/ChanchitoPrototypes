# Design Principles

## Color Governance

### Rule: 95% Neutrals, 5-10% User-Generated Colors

- **95% of UI uses neutrals or white surfaces**
- **User-generated colors never fill more than 5–10% of the screen**
- Ensures feed remains visually breathable even with varied content

## White Space Ratio

### High White Space for Breathability

- Large paddings (24px minimum for cards)
- Stable vertical rhythm
- Even card spacing
- Minimal border usage
- White space is the best antidote against color overload

## Card Structure

### Predictable Layout

Users should learn:
- Title position (top-left)
- Vote buttons placement (bottom-left)
- Tags area (bottom-right)
- Summary text (center)
- Action area (bottom)

Predictability reduces cognitive load and encourages more voting.

## Typography

### Limited Styles

- **One primary typeface**: Inter (or SF Pro, Work Sans, Neue Haas Grotesk)
- **Weight variations**: 400 (normal), 500 (medium), 600 (semibold)
- **No italic or decorative fonts** for readability
- **Max two font sizes per card**

## Motion

### Micro-Animations

- Soft fade-ins on scroll
- Bounceless transitions (250ms ease)
- Upvote animation with subtle pop and glow
- Animations create emotional reward without distracting

## Color Palette

### Black & White + Thin Accents

**Core Colors:**
- Background: `#FDFDFD` (Almost-white)
- Primary Text: `#111111` (Almost-black)
- Secondary Text: `#6A6A6A` (Mid gray)
- Accent: `#CFF56A` (Lemon-Lime Soft Neon) or `#66D3FF` (Sky Blue)

**Why this works:**
- Strict B/W environment acts as a "gallery" where all content stands out
- Pops of neon or bright accents create delight without overwhelming
- Feels technological, modern, confident, and serious

## Shapes

- Minimal shapes with 2–4px radius
- Sharp and editorial
- Full-bleed spacing for cards (NY Times or Medium-like)

## Feed Behavior

- Every piece of user-generated content is monochrome except for category tags
- UI frame stays stable even with colorful user content
- Emotional outcome: Feels technological, modern, confident, and serious
